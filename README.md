# odt
search/replace in odt (OpenDocument Text) files

This "library" is actually just a dirty hack that does only one thing:
search/replace tokens in odt files. Useful for mailing for instance,
when you want to replace the token |NAME| by names from a list, etc.

It works for me, and I use in at work, but there is **no** guarantee
whatsoever that it works on every odt file out there. Always keep a
copy of the orignial file, of course!
